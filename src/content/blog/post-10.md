I found some contact sheets of pictures I took, probably junior year when I was on Spartan Scroll photo staff.

I apologize in advance for the quality, since they are just scans from  printed contact sheet pages.

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmnc/albums/72177720323584950/" target="_blank">Fargo North High album</a></p>

Enjoy!

P.S. If anyone is curious, I also have photo albums of the 2017 and 2024 total solar eclipses. They are in the same place, just click on the "Back to album list" link.
